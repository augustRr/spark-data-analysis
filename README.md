Scala Spark Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Scala Spark Data Analysis project repository! This repository contains code and resources related to my journey as a data analyst using the Apache Spark framework with Scala programming language. This README file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and instructions to get started.
Project Overview

Aspiring to become a data analyst, I'm utilizing the powerful capabilities of Apache Spark and Scala to work with large datasets, perform data transformations, gain insights, and visualize results. This project focuses on developing my skills in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization within the context of big data processing.

Getting Started
1-) Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/scala-spark-data-analysis.git
2-) Setup:
      Make sure you have Apache Spark and Scala installed on your system.
      You can use tools like 'sbt' (Scala Build Tool) to compile and run Scala scripts.
3-) Running Analyses:
      Navigate to the src/main/scala/ directory to see sample analysis scripts.
      Modify and extend these scripts based on your data analysis goals.
      Use the Spark documentation and resources to explore available transformations and actions.
4-)  The src/main/resources directory contains sample data files for your practice.
    You can replace these with your own datasets or use them for initial exploration.
